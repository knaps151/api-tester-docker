You are an expert AI programmer. Your task is to fix several critical bugs and implement security/usability improvements in the "apitester" web application.You have access to the following files:api.php (Main backend logic)index.html (Log viewer)template-management.html (Template editor)post-form.html (Request sender)config.php (Configuration)README.md (Documentation)Please perform the following actions to fix the application:1. Fix Critical PHP Parse Error in api.phpFile: api.phpAction: Find and remove the single, stray closing curly brace } at the very end of the api.php file. This is a syntax error that is causing the entire API to fail with a 500 error.2. Implement Log File Deletion in api.phpFile: api.phpContext: The DELETE case in api.php is only written to delete templates from templates.json. The index.html file sends a DELETE request with {"filename": "..."} to delete logs, but this is not handled.Action: Modify the case 'DELETE' block.It must check the incoming JSON body.If the JSON contains a "filename" key, it should delete the specified file from the LOG_DIRECTORY defined in config.php.Security: Use basename() on the filename to prevent directory traversal.Security: Construct the full path and check that the file exists within the LOG_DIRECTORY before unlinking it.If the JSON contains a "name" key, it should perform the existing logic to delete a template from templates.json.Return appropriate JSON success or error messages for either operation.3. Fix Incomplete Template Saving in api.phpFile: api.phpContext: The template-management.html page sends a complete template object (including method, headers, queryParams, etc.). However, the case 'POST' in api.php only saves endpoint and payload, ignoring all other fields. This breaks the "Send Request" form, which expects the full template data.Action: Modify the case 'POST' block.Instead of only pulling endpoint and payload, it should save the entire data object it receives as the template's value.The name should be used as the key.Example:Read the $data = json_decode($rawBody, true);Get the template name: $templateName = $data['name'];Remove the name from the data object: unset($data['name']);Save the entire remaining $data object as the value: $templates[$templateName] = $data;4. Secure the Log ListingContext: index.html fetches the raw /logs/ directory URL and scrapes the HTML for links. This is insecure and relies on "directory indexing" being enabled on the server.Action (Part A: api.php):Create a new handler for GET requests.If a GET request is received (e.g., with a query string like ?action=listLogs), it should:Use PHP's glob() or scandir() function to read all .json filenames from the LOG_DIRECTORY (from config.php).Set the Content-Type header to application/json.echo the list of filenames as a JSON array.Action (Part B: index.html):Modify the fetchLogs JavaScript function.Change the fetch(logsUrl) URL from http://10.0.0.1/apitester/logs/ to the new API endpoint (e.g., http://10.0.0.1/apitester/api.php?action=listLogs).The response will now be JSON, not HTML. Remove the response.text() and HTML regex parsing.Instead, parse the response.json() and assign the resulting array to the logs variable.The existing applyFilterAndRender() function should then work correctly with the new logs array.5. Fix Insecure Permissions in README.mdFile: README.mdAction: Find the setup instructions that recommend chmod 777 /var/www/html/apitester/templates.json.Replace this with more secure permissions, such as:Setting the correct owner: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/apitesterSetting appropriate file permissions: sudo chmod 664 /var/www/html/apitester/templates.json and sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html/apitester/logs6. Fix Minor UI InconsistencyFile: index.htmlAction: In the top navigation bar, find the link with the text "Send POST Request" and change the text to "Send Request" to be consistent with the other pages.
